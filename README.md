Credits first!
--------------

My big thanks goes to [Matthew M. Boedicker](https://github.com/mmb) for his [meme_captain](https://github.com/mmb/meme_captain) gem and [the website of the same name](http://memecaptain.com/) which made this bot possible!

Available memes
---------------
So far Yuno bot supports these memes:

* [Y U NO](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/y-u-no-guy) (which it dervies its name from, as this was [the first meme to be coded](https://github.com/Holek/Yuno/compare/6d4e20bae2...bff40ff236))
* [The Most Interesting Man in the World](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-most-interesting-man-in-the-world) (also known as "I don't always ... but when I do ...")
* [X all the Y](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/x-all-the-y) (including "ALL THE THINGS?")
* [Not Sure If X](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/futurama-fry-not-sure-if-x)
* [Yo Dawg](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/xzibit-yo-dawg)
* [Friendship is B**ch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY)

How to use that bot
-------------------

So far the Awesome Bot Factory doesn't have the automatic bot registration yet. Until it does, you have to add a new skill to your bot.

If you want to use a stock Yuno described here, you can fill the URL for skill with:

    http://abf-yuno.herokuapp.com/yuno

The regex invoking the bot is:

    ^(NOT SURE IF|YO DAWG|)(.*)((Y U NO|BUT WHEN I DO|ALL THE|OR|SO|YO DAWG) (.+)| ON THE MOO+N| HAS BEEN DOUBLED)$
